            Stevens McFarlane is a director of brand marketing, with experience managing global teams and multi-million-dollar campaigns. His background in brand strategy, visual design, and account management inform his mindful but competitive approach. Stevens is fuelled by his passion for understanding the nuances of cross-cultural advertising. He considers himself a forever student, eager to both build on his academic foundations in psychology and sociology and stay in tune with the latest digital marketing strategies through continued coursework.
  His hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action has contributed to his most recent success at Rockwell Group, while he led international, award-winning campaigns for heavy-hitting brands, such as Puma, Gucci, and Rolex. Meanwhile, he vastly improved the productivity of his team by implementing strategic project management methods and ensuring a work-life balance for his department.
  Stevens believes mindfulness in the workplace is key to success - a tenet he lives out through his interests in yoga, meditation, gardening, and painting. Stevens is currently working as a freelance marketing director and is always interested in a challenge. Reach out to Stevensmcfarlane98@gmail.com to connect!
